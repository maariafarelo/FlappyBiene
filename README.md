## What is FlappyBiene?
Flappy Biene is a Python game I created to improve my Python skills, as it's a brand-new programming language for me that I started learning a few weeks ago. It's inspired by some YouTube tutorials, but I didnâ€™t want to create the classic Flappy Bird. So, put my own twist on it by developing a version featuring my HackUPC organizer's avatar, my Biene, and making it space-themed to align with HackUPC 2024

## Design
The astronaut vector was created by HackUPC's design team for our landing page (www.hackupc.com), so I just had to combine it with my Biene. As for the other images, I illustrated the floor using Figma and designed the 'GAME OVER' message and the initial screen with some inspiration, as you can see below.

## Does it work?
It's the first version of the game. It works, but it definitely needs some improvements, as it still has a few mistakes.
